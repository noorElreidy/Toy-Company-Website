            <p>This is our leader and president Noor Elreidy. She is very pretty and smart. She deserves a 100% on her assignment.  Noor was born in Egypt and she has studied hard to overcome this obstacle. She successfully managed to get a scholarship in a university in the UK and is currently trying her best to keep up with the fast pace of teaching. Noor is thankful that her father has worked hard to make enough money to send her abroad for university, and she is trying her hardest not to disappoint him.

            <p>This is our vice president Noor Ahmed, aka Noor Elreidy. She is super nice and lovely, and she also deserves a 100%. A fun fact about Noor is that she stepped on two different dead rats, on two different occassions. It's not a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi vestibulum nunc diam, at auctor quam pulvinar id.

            <p>This is our CEO Noor Shafik, aka Noor Elreidy. Noor decided to actually really study CS just before her last year of high school. She dropped A2 Biology and registered for A Level Computer Science just before the school year started. It was the first time her school opened an A level CS class, and they brought a new teacher. The teacher is called Maged Wageeh, and he is one of the best teachers Noor has ever had. Noor is his assistant now and corrects exam papers for him.
