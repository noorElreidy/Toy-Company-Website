        <p>Our collaboration with Oak Creek Mountain Stream River elementary school, which was our first collaboration ever, was the epitome of a success. We would have never thought that our projects would create that much impact on the world. Within a year of the school's students and teachers using our software, students' scores improved by 70%, student interaction in class increased by 50%, and time taken to cover content decreased by 20%. </p>
        <p>One of our most successful projects right now is the Robotics UltraPro software, which is suitable for ages 7 and upwards.It is a simulation software that allows sudents to assemble small functional robots piece by piece. After learning through the simulation, students can assemble the real robots with the option of watching a screen capture of how they assembled the robots. Tutorials are available on the software as well. After assembly, students can use block code to give the robots instructions. They can test their algorithms out on the simulation, and they can also connect to the robots and have them excute the instructions in real life. There are tutorials for how to build block code, as well as examples. We do recommend that the actual robots be used for ages 10 and upwards since the robots are quite fragile. </p>    
        <p>This was not our last collaboration alhamdulillah. We have collaborated with many other schools like OCMSR high school, Riverdale high, Brbrbr barabom middle school, The leaky winky beaky elementary school and SoCold elementary school. We have made them their own custom software from scratch as well as only added modifications to our default softwares. Some of our softwares are the Extriminator 100 for getting rid of annoying children, the VirtualTeacher which can assist students in their studies, and the omgIcan't which teachers can use to create their own interactive teaching games. All our softwares have nice user-freindly interfaces that anyone can use, and there are tutortials available for anyone who struggles anyways. </p>
